# Getting your source code added.

We want to stress that the biggest issue facing consumers today is security in the apps and extensions they use on a daily basis.
With that in mind, our goal towards continuous improvement will allow us to ensure that this project when deployed keeps
those issues at heart without sacrificing functionality.

Other things that will be stressed is overall readability of source code. 

We definitely get that everyone has their own styles but good documentation and commenting is going to help everyone who contributes to
this project.

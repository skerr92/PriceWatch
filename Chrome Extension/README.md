# Getting Started

Welcome to this part of the PriceWatch repository. Typically this is a project to be done in python but as things would have it,
using this as a Chrome extension adds a whole layer of usability to the PriceWatch project, especially in ways to hopefully
automate our shopping habits more.

Our objectives for this extension are outlined in the issues tab. It is the only issue in there right now, but that might and 
probably will change soon.

<b>A Few Objectives</b>

Tranlating the python code into JavaScript (probably a mix of jQuery and React) to get started.

# Updates

<b>May 11th, 2019</b> 
We've added the manifest.json file needed to get started with the chrome extension as well as the content.js and scaper.js files needed. Add on and build into these files.

# Getting your source code added.

We want to stress that the biggest issue facing consumers today is security in the apps and extensions they use on a daily basis.
With that in mind, our goal towards continuous improvement will allow us to ensure that this project when deployed keeps
those issues at heart without sacrificing functionality.

Other things that will be stressed is overall readability of source code. 

We definitely get that everyone has their own styles but good documentation and commenting is going to help everyone who contributes to
this project.
